 WSGI Tackling Framework (WTF)
===============================

|**WTF**| (WSGI Tackling Framework) is a WSGI based meta-framework
written in python with optional speedup code written in C.

WSGI is described here: <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/>

Meta-framework means, that the package helps you build your own framework
out of it.

WTF is currently available for python2 versions only (starting with
python 2.4). Python 3 is not supported yet.
